Working with DNA sequences, especially if you don't have a Unix machine handy might need a few tools. Some of the modifications are simple enough that even a trivial Vim script would deal with.
What you can do:
- get the reverse-complement of a sequence
- count A/T/C/Gs in a sequence and get a very crude Tm for a primer
- brush-up a few file formats (PS from ClustalX, FASTA etc).

Many thanks to Will Nater and Tim Chase for helping!

Version "1.0" means that, up to now, I did not have any screwed-up sequence, but this is far from saying that it's definitely foolproof.
